# Bokeh: Interactive Visualization Library

Bokeh is a powerful Python library that allows you to create interactive, JavaScript-powered visualizations, which can be displayed in web browsers. Its main goal is to provide an easy-to-use and flexible framework for building interactive plots and dashboards.

## How Bokeh Works

Bokeh follows a two-step process to create visualizations:

1. **Building Blocks**: In the first step, you select from Bokeh's building blocks to create your visualization. Bokeh offers a variety of plot types, such as line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, and more. You can also add widgets like sliders, buttons, and dropdowns to create interactive elements.

2. **Customization**: Once you have defined the building blocks of your visualization, you can customize them to fit your specific needs. Bokeh provides a high level of control over various aspects of your plots, including colors, markers, labels, and tooltips.

## Combining Python and JavaScript

Bokeh operates by combining two essential elements:

1. **Python Library**: Bokeh's Python library allows you to define the content and interactive functionalities of your visualization using Python code. It provides an intuitive and straightforward API to create and configure plots and widgets.

2. **BokehJS**: In the background, Bokeh uses a JavaScript library called BokehJS. BokehJS handles the rendering and display of your interactive visualizations in web browsers. The library leverages the capabilities of modern web browsers to enable dynamic interactions and responsive plots.

## Getting Started

To start using Bokeh, follow these simple steps:

1. Install Bokeh: Use `pip` to install Bokeh.

   ```
   pip install bokeh
   ```

2. Import Bokeh in your Python script or Jupyter Notebook.

   ```python
   import bokeh.plotting as bplt
   from bokeh.io import output_notebook
   ```

3. Create your visualization using Bokeh's building blocks.

   ```python
   # Example: Create a line plot
   p = bplt.figure(title="Line Plot Example", x_axis_label="X-axis", y_axis_label="Y-axis")
   p.line(x=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], y=[5, 7, 3, 8, 4], line_width=2)
   ```

4. Customize your plot as needed.

   ```python
   # Example: Add a legend and tooltips
   p.legend.label_text_font_size = '12pt'
   p.add_tools(bplt.HoverTool(tooltips=[("X-value", "@x"), ("Y-value", "@y")]))
   ```

5. Show your interactive visualization.

   ```python
   output_notebook()  # Display the plot in Jupyter Notebook
   bplt.show(p)       # Show the plot
   ```
